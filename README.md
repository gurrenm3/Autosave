# BTD6-Auto-save
This mod will automatically save BTD6 and keep backups of it. Very helpful when playing with mods as saves can get corrupted. By default it will auto-save every
30 minutes, or every time you exit a game and go to the main menu. It will also only keep the last 10 backup saves, then it will delete the oldest to make room for more.
You can go to the Mod Settings Menu to change these values. From the Settings Menu you can also change the backup directory, open it, 
and open the actual BTD6 Save directory so you can easily swap save files
